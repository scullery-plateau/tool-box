      "Description": "You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric-performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power. Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being, and work with your DM to detail the nature of your religious service. The Gods of the Multiverse section contains a sample pantheon, from the Forgotten Realms setting. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny. * Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Religion * Languages: Two of your choice * Equipment: A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp Source: Player's Handbook p. 127",
      "Feature: Shelter of the Faithful": "As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle. You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.",
      "Suggested Characteristics": "Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals.

By studying other cultures' customs, philosophies, laws, rituals, religious beliefs, languages, and art, you have learned how tribes, empires, and all forms of society in between craft their own destinies and doom.

      "Description": "An archaeologist learns about the long-lost and fallen cultures of the past by studying their remains-their bones, their ruins, their surviving masterworks, and their tombs.

      "Dust Digger": "Prior to becoming an adventurer, you spent most of your young life crawling around in the dust, pilfering relics of questionable value from crypts and ruins.

In addition, you can determine the monetary value of art objects more than a century old.",
      "Suggested Characteristics": "Few archaeologists can resist the lure of an unexplored ruin or dungeon, particularly if such a site is the source of legends or is rumored to contain the treasures and relics of wizards, warlords, or royalty. Some archaeologists plunder for wealth or fame, while others consider it their calling to illuminate the past or keep the world's greatest treasures from falling into the wrong hands. Whatever their motivations, archaeologists combine the qualities of a scrappy historian with the self-made heroism of a treasure-hunting scoundrel. d8 | Personality Trait 1 | I love a good puzzle or mystery 2 | I'm a pack rat who never throws anything away. 3 | Fame is more important to me than money. 4 | I have no qualms about stealing from the dead. 5 | I'm happier in a dusty old tomb than I am in the centers of civilization. 6 | Traps don't make me nervous.

      "Contacts": "The Azorius Senate is a sprawling bureaucracy, and people in a variety of positions throughout the guild can pull strings to make things happen.

      "Description": "The brutes are at the gate, chaos is looming, and the only thing standing in the way of disaster is the foundation of law and order-as embodied in the Azorius Senate.

Showing your Azorius insignia gets you an audience with anyone you want to talk to (though it might cause more problems than it solves when you're dealing with incorrigible lawbreakers). If you abuse this privilege, though, you can get in serious trouble with your superiors and even be stripped of your position.",
      "How Do I Fit In?": "As a member of the Azorius Senate, you are probably engaged in the work of law enforcement (even if your background involved the legislative or judicial aspects of the senate's activities). Legislative aides and judges' clerks find little reason to venture beyond the Azorius guildhalls, but soldiers and lawmages patrol the streets daily. An Azorius soldier or lawmage is a force for order, charged with fighting crime on the streets-and in the halls of power. You might spend your time foiling thefts, putting a stop to Orzhov extortion, rooting out Dimir spies, or hunting down Golgari assassins. Perhaps you take your orders from a precognitive mage (or you are one yourself) who receives unpredictable and cryptic visions of future crimes that you and your allies must try to prevent.",
      "Suggested Characteristics": "Members of the Azorius Senate tend toward a demeanor of cold dignity and a pragmatic, orderly nature. Steeped in the law as they are, their ideals and priorities revolve around legal issues. Personality Traits d8 | Trait 1 | I try never to let my judgment become clouded by emotion. 2 | I have infinite patience with the dolts and boors I'm forced to deal with every day. 3 | When I give an order, I expect it to be obeyed. 4 | I just want things the way I like them: neat, orderly, and clean. 5 | No wrongdoing can escape my watchful gaze. 6 | I always say exactly what I mean, no matter how many words it takes to communicate the particular nuance I am attempting to convey. 7 | I'm very literal and don't appreciate metaphor or sarcasm. 8 | I never change my mind once it's made up.

(Evil) Bonds d6 | Bond 1 | I am beholden to an Azorius arrester who captured the criminal who killed my parents, saving me from the same fate. 2 | I hope one day to write the laws, not just enforce them. 3 | I tried and failed to prevent a murder, and I have sworn to find and arrest the perpetrator. 4 | I successfully prevented a murder, and the would-be perpetrator wants me dead. 5 | One of my parents was prominent in the guild, and I resent constantly being compared to that standard. 6 | I've modeled my career after a highly respected lawmage or arrester, but I fear that my role model might be involved in something illegal. Flaws d6 | Flaw 1 | I'm unable to distinguish between the letter and the spirit of the law. 2 | I seem like a harsh judge to others, but I judge myself most harshly of all. 3 | I have a secret, illegal vice. 4 | I was traumatized by witnessing a crime as a child. 5 | I'm incapable of deception. 6 | I wish I had joined the Boros, but I fear they'd never accept me."

This operative will hear you out and, at their discretion, take your information or request up their chain of command. These meetings almost always occur in shady venues.",
      "Criminal Origins": "Criminals are pervasive in Baldur's Gate. If you wish, you may roll on the Criminal Origins table for an event that began your life of crime. Criminal Origins d8 | Origin 1 | You crippled a Guild kingpin's cousin without realizing the connection. You got the Guild to back off demands for your death by offering to make amends by working for the criminals, but even so the kingpin still plots a personal revenge. 2 | The Guild took over your family business, ran it into the ground, and burned the building for insurance money. You were driven into crime yourself, but you'll never work for the Guild. You take special joy in hitting its targets first, tipping off its con victims and otherwise frustrating its schemes. 3 | It's always been about money. You're not paid what you're worth, working for someone who has more than they deserve. But the Guild offered you a way to fix that. You keep doing what you've always done-guard work, dock labor, business accounting-but what you learn you pass on to the Guild. 4 | The inequality of Baldur's Gate has driven you to take matters into your own hands. You steal from patriars and rich Lower City residents, funneling the money through charitable fronts to help the needy. 5 | You got into crime as a bored patriar looking for excitement. Your family has no idea of your activities, and neither does the Guild. If either of them ever finds out, your life as you know it will be over. 6 | A close friend or relative joined the Guild and vanished mysteriously. You've worked your way into the lower ranks hoping to find out what happened to them. 7 | You've always wanted to be a member of the Guild. As a child, you looked up to the Guild members' swagger, their flashy dress, and their competence, which all marked them as different from the other adults you knew. As soon as you could, you joined the organization. 8 | To you, this is just a way to earn a living. You go to work, do what needs to be done, and get paid. Anyone who pursues crime for thrill-seeking, to strike back at unjust authorities, or anything else are amateurs, and they're liable to get you arrested or killed with their idiocy.",

I never raise my voice or let my emotions control me. 3 | The first thing I do in a new place is note the locations of everything valuable-or where such things could be hidden. 4 | I would rather make a new friend than a new enemy. 5 | I am incredibly slow to trust. Those who seem the fairest often have the most to hide. 6 | I don't pay attention to the risks in a situation. Never tell me the odds. 7 | The best way to get me to do something is to tell me I can't do it. 8 | I blow up at the slightest insult. d6 | Ideal 1 | Honor. I don't steal from others in the trade.

I must someday confront them. 3 | I'm still seeking the enlightenment I pursued in my seclusion, and it still eludes me. 4 | I entered seclusion because I loved someone I could not have. 5 | Should my discovery come to light, it could bring ruin to the world. 6 | My isolation gave me great insight into a great evil that only I can destroy. d6 | Flaw 1 | Now that I've returned to the world, I enjoy its delights a little too much. 2 | I harbor dark, bloodthirsty thoughts that my isolation and meditation failed to quell. 3 | I am dogmatic in my thoughts and philosophy. 4 | I let my need to win arguments overshadow friendships and harmony. 5 | I'd risk too much to uncover a lost bit of knowledge. 6 | I like keeping secrets and won't share them with anyone."

      "Contacts": "The ordered structure of the Boros Legion offers abundant opportunities to make friends-and rivals-in higher places. You might have close friends in other guilds that share the Boros emphasis on order and community, or bitter enemies among the guilds that represent chaos and destruction. Roll twice on the Boros Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Boros Contacts table.

      "Description": "As a member of the Boros Legion, your life is devoted to the service of angels and consecrated to the work of establishing justice and peace on the streets of Ravnica. You might be a true believer, inspired by the example of the angels, moved by the plight of the downtrodden, and devoted to the cause of justice. Or you could be a cynic in the ranks, perhaps because you reluctantly followed in the footsteps of a Boros parent, succumbed to the persuasion of a charismatic recruiter's lofty promises, or were drawn in by the prospect of a life of action. * Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Intimidation * Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set * Languages: Choose one of Celestial, Draconic, Goblin, or Minotaur * Equipment: A Boros insignia, a feather from an angel's wing, a tattered piece of a Boros banner (a souvenir from a famous battle), a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 2 gp (Boros-minted 1-zino coins) Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 40",

      "How Do I Fit In?": "As a member of the Boros Legion, you are subject to the orders of your superior officers. You go where the angels tell you to go, and you do what they command you to do, to the best of your ability. If you enjoy some measure of independence, it's either because you have proven yourself capable of working without close supervision or because you're a rebellious sort who is willing to disobey orders now and face the consequences later. As a soldier on the street, you are tasked with bringing dangerous threats like the Rakdos and the Gruul in line. You might contend with Rakdos performances gone horribly out of control, Gruul raids on outlying neighborhoods, shipments of rot-infested vegetation from the Golgari undercity, and violent uprisings among the guildless. At the same time, you might have to worry about Dimir spies infiltrating your leadership, overzealous or corrupt Azorius senators abusing the law at the expense of justice, Izzet experiments leveling city blocks, and Simic creations that break out of laboratories and wreak havoc through the Tenth District.",
      "Suggested Characteristics": "The Boros Legion is a zealous army, full of righteous energy tempered with military discipline.

If you aren't a dwarf, however, you have taken a solemn oath never to take on an apprentice in the craft: it is not for nondwarves to pass on the skills of Moradin's favored children. You would have no difficulty, however, finding a dwarf master who was willing to receive potential apprentices who came with your recommendation. * Skill Proficiencies: History, Insight * Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan's tools * Languages: Dwarvish or one of your choice if you already speak Dwarvish * Equipment: A set of artisan's tools with which you are proficient, a maker's mark chisel used to mark your handiwork with the symbol of the clan of crafters you learned your skill from, a set of traveler's clothes, and a pouch containing 5 gp and a gem worth 10 gp Source: Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide p. 145",
      "Feature: Respect of the Stout Folk": "As well respected as clan crafters are among outsiders, no one esteems them quite so highly as dwarves do. You always have free room and board in any place where shield dwarves or gold dwarves dwell, and the individuals in such a settlement might vie among themselves to determine who can offer you (and possibly your companions) the finest accommodations and assistance.",
      "Suggested Characteristics": "Use the tables for the guild artisan background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a clan crafter. (For instance, consider the words \"guild\" and \"clan\" to be interchangeable.) Your bond is almost certainly related to the master or the clan that taught you, or else to the work that you produce. Your ideal might have to do with maintaining the high quality of your work or preserving the dwarven traditions of craftsmanship."

      "Description": "As a child, you were inquisitive when your playmates were possessive or raucous. In your formative years, you found your way to one of Faerûn's great institutes of learning, where you were apprenticed and taught that knowledge is a more valuable treasure than gold or gems. Now you are ready to leave your home-not to abandon it, but to quest for new lore to add to its storehouse of knowledge. The most well known of Faerûn's fonts of knowledge is Candlekeep. The great library is always in need of workers and attendants, some of whom rise through the ranks to assume roles of greater responsibility and prominence. You might be one of Candlekeep's own, dedicated to the curatorship of what is likely the most complete body of lore and history in all the world. Perhaps instead you were taken in by the scholars of the Vault of the Sages or the Map House in Silverymoon, and now you have struck out to increase your knowledge and to make yourself available to help those in other places who seek your expertise. You might be one of the few who aid Herald's Holdfast, helping to catalogue and maintain records of the information that arrives daily from across Faerûn. * Skill Proficiencies: History, plus your choice of one from among Arcana, Nature, and Religion * Languages: any two of your choice * Equipment: The scholar's robes of your cloister, a writing kit (small pouch with a quill, ink, folded parchment, and a small penknife), a borrowed book on the subject of your current study, and a pouch containing 10 gp Source: Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide p. 146",

You have a working knowledge of your cloister's personnel and bureaucracy, and you know how to navigate those connections with some ease. Additionally, you are likely to gain preferential treatment at other libraries across the Realms, as professional courtesy to a fellow scholar.",

Your bond is almost certainly associated either with the place where you grew up or with the knowledge you hope to acquire through adventuring.

Rather, these dissenters simply refuse to follow the ordained course of life that leads to the glorious afterlife. Some dissenters are spurred by fear, not wanting to subject themselves to a violent death in the trials (or in training for the trials). Some are moved by conscience, unwilling to kill their crop-mates in the trials. For while they cannot deny that the gods exist, they can deny that the gods are just-and can fight to prove that the dictates of an unjust god need not be obeyed. Some believe that one god (probably Bontu) has corrupted the process of the trials and the path to the afterlife. Others correctly intuit that the God-Pharaoh did not actually have the people's best interests in mind when he ordered their society.

You can parlay this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your companions. Nobles, scholars, mages, and those who seek to ferret out the secrets of the Maimed Virulence would all be keen to hear your tale of survival, and learn what secrets (if any) you might possess, and/or study your affliction with great interest.

These factions pursue their agendas without regard for political boundaries, and their members operate anywhere the organization deems necessary. These groups employ listeners, rumormongers, smugglers, sellswords, cache-holders (people who guard caches of wealth or magic for use by the faction's operatives), haven keepers, and message drop minders, to name a few. At the core of every faction are those who don't merely fulfill a small function for that organization, but who serve as its hands, head, and heart. As a prelude to your adventuring career (and in preparation for it), you served as an agent of a particular faction in Faerûn. You might have operated openly or secretly, depending on the faction and its goals, as well as how those goals mesh with your own.

      "Factions of the Sword Coast": "The lack of large, centralized governments in the North and along the Sword Coast is likely directly responsible for the proliferation of secret societies and conspiracies in those lands.

Your bond might be associated with other members of your faction, or a location or an object that is important to your faction.

Prepared to pursue the life of an adventurer, your insight into the world of commerce brought you into the sphere of Acquisitions Incorporated-and a franchise just might be in your future. * Skill Proficiencies: Investigation, Persuasion * Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan's tools * Languages: Any one of your choice * Equipment: One set of artisan's tools, merchant's scale, a set of fine clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp Source: Acquisitions Incorporated p. 49",
      "Feature: Supply Chain": "From your time as a merchant, you retain connections with wholesalers, suppliers, and other merchants and entrepreneurs. You can call upon these connections when looking for items or information.",
      "Suggested Characteristics": "Being a merchant involved having a head for numbers, a strong personality, the ability to make deals with hostile adversaries, a strong sword arm to fight off bandits, and the intuition for knowing what people want and need. The art of business is the art of finding the best path to profit, and that path might be different with each transaction. It takes a strong mind and a stronger stomach to succeed. So why did you fail? d8 | Personality Trait 1 | I didn't have the cutthroat attitude necessary to succeed. I won't make that mistake again. 2 | Even my competitors said I was affable and talented. Those traits should serve me well. 3 | To prosper, you have to be in control. 4 | The customer is always right. 5 | I was cutting corners and breaking deals to maximize profit. That's why I failed. 6 | When I get an idea, I am single-minded in its execution-even if it's a terrible idea. 7 | If I can be everyone's friend, I'll always have support. 8 | My heart wasn't in being a merchant, so I failed. I'm not all that keen on adventuring either, but I need the money. d6 | Ideal 1 | Survival. Where there's life, there's hope. If I remain alive and flexible, I can succeed. (Any) 2 | Generosity. People helped me when I was down. Now that I'm back on my feet, I'll pay it forward. (Good) 3 | Excitement. Caution got me nowhere in my previous business. I'm not going to let it hold me back now. (Chaotic) 4 | Wealth. With enough coin, I can buy comfort, power, knowledge, and even eternal life. Nothing will stand between me and money. (Evil) 5 | Stability. The mercantile trade was too chaotic for me. I need a nice stable profession, like adventuring. (Lawful) 6 | Redemption. Too many people consider me a failure. So I need to prove them wrong. (Any) d6 | Bond 1 | My family means everything to me. I failed them before, and I must not do so again. 2 | My church provides a connection to my god, so I must ensure that it is protected and funded. 3 | My former business partner fell ill, and then our business failed. Part of my new venture involves earning enough to take care of their family. 4 | If I take care of my possessions, they'll take care of me. People come and go, but a weapon or a wand is something you can always rely on. 5 | Although my business failed, the people of my community were kind to me. I'll do everything in my power to protect them. 6 | I owe a dangerous person a lot of money. As long as they're happy, they let my debt rest unpaid. d6 | Flaw 1 | Why spend gold here when you can buy the same thing for copper in the next town? 2 | I must have the best of everything. Like, right now. 3 | You haven't heard of me? I'm sure that's because of your ignorance and low breeding. 4 | I failed, but I'm awesome. So when anyone else is successful, it must be because of nepotism, dishonesty, or dumb luck. 5 | I find that most people are trustworthy. Hey, where's my belt pouch? 6 | Nothing gets between me and danger except my fellow adventurers. So I'll be sure to put them there."

You aren't one of those folk. You are from a distant place, one so remote that few of the common folk in the North realize that it exists, and chances are good that even if some people you meet have heard of your homeland, they know merely the name and perhaps a few outrageous stories. You have come to this part of Faerûn for your own reasons, which you might or might not choose to share. Although you will undoubtedly find some of this land's ways to be strange and discomfiting, you can also be sure that some things its people take for granted will be to you new wonders that you've never laid eyes on before.

You can parley this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions.

Perhaps you were born into a family of fisher folk, working with your kin to feed your village.

Regardless of how you began, you soon fell in love with the sea, the art of fishing, and the promise of the eternal horizon. * Skill Proficiencies: History, Survival * Languages: One of your choice * Equipment: Fishing tackle, a net, a favorite fishing lure or oiled leather wading boots, a set of traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 29",
      "Feature: Harvest the Water": "You gain advantage on ability checks made using fishing tackle. If you have access to a body of water that sustains marine life, you can maintain a moderate lifestyle while working as a fisher, and you can catch enough food to feed yourself and up to ten other people each day.",
      "Fishing Tale": "You can tell a compelling tale, whether tall or true, to impress and entertain others. Once a day, you can tell your story to willing listeners. At the DM's discretion, a number of those listeners become friendly toward you; this is not a magical effect, and continued amicability on their part depends on your actions. You can roll on the following table to help determine the theme of your tale or choose one that best fits your character. Alternatively, work with your DM to create your own fishing tale. d8 | Tale 1 | Lobster Wrestling. You fought in hand-to-hand combat with an immense lobster. 2 | It Dragged the Boat. You nearly caught a fish of monstrous size that pulled your boat for miles. 3 | Fins of Pure Gold. You caught a sea animal whose fins were made of pure gold, but another fisher stole it. 4 | Ghost Fish. You are haunted by a ghostly fish that only you can see. 5 | Nemesis Clam.

You fell in love with a creature of pure water, but your brief romance ended tragically.",
      "Suggested Characteristics": "Fishers succeed only if they spend time at their jobs. As such, most fishers have a strong work ethic, and they admire others who earn their living honestly.

Golgari Guild Spells Spell Level | Spells Cantrip | dancing lights, spare the dying 1st | entangle, ray of sickness 2nd | protection from poison, ray of enfeeblement, spider climb 3rd | animate dead, plant growth 4th | giant insect, grasping vine 5th | cloudkill, insect plague Golgari magic is often accompanied by a sickly green glow and a rotting stench.",
      "How Do I Fit In?": "As part of the Golgari Swarm, you are a specialized instrument of the greater body. Your orders, when you have such, come from the guildmaster by way of his chancellors, who carry his messages throughout the guild. The swarm relies on you to advance the greater good by protecting some part, however small, of its teeming existence. That responsibility doesn't mean you're indispensable; your eventual death is part of your purpose and function, too, and you'll be replaced even as your body provides nutrients to further the swarm's growth. A classic adventuring role for a member of the Golgari involves crawling through dungeon-like environments-the sewers and ancient vaults of the undercity-in search of treasures left behind by the dead. Sometimes you might be sent to find a specific item believed lost in a dangerous part of the undercity. At other times, you could be asked to collect samples of a specific fungus, retrieve a body floating in the muck of the sewers, or bring back whatever booty you can to help fill the swarm's coffers. You might gain enough renown to become a member of the Ochran, assigned to a variety of tasks concerning thievery, assassination, or the protection of important figures in your guild. You might steal something because the guild needs it, or because its loss will bring harm to another guild, hastening that group's decline. You could be assigned to kill an outspoken and active enemy of the Golgari, such as an overzealous Boros captain whose raids into the undercity have approached dangerously close to the swarm's inner sanctum. Or you could serve as a bodyguard to one of Guildmaster Jarad's high chancellors, escorting this figure through the undercity while being ready to intervene at a moment's notice if things go wrong. The shamans of the Golgari use their magic to accelerate the cycle of decay and regrowth. You might be sent to spread spores throughout an area that the Golgari want to claim as their territory or to convince the inhabitants of such a territory to abandon it. You might also contend with the ever-present threat of hostile monsters encroaching into Golgari-controlled regions.",
      "Suggested Characteristics": "Members of the Golgari Swarm are unmistakably products of the undercity, ill at ease amid the comforts of civilization. They bring about the same discomfort in others by reminding them of death's inevitable approach. Personality Traits d8 | Personality Trait 1 | Remember, I could kill you in your sleep. Or put centipedes in your bedroll. 2 | I like to remind people of their inevitable demise. 3 | Sometimes I give voice to the whispers of the rot, which I hear but no one else does. 4 | I do my best to discourage anyone from approaching or talking to me. 5 | I have accepted my death. Hence, I don't fear it. 6 | Like roots growing through stone, I am relentless and determined in my action. 7 | I put my knowledge of anatomy to use by narrating the injuries my enemies suffer in grisly detail. 8 | Like a wild animal, I lash out viciously when I'm provoked-and I'm easily provoked. Ideals d6 | Ideal 1 | Guild. My guild is all that really matters. (Any) 2 | Stoicism. All of us are part of the cyclical march of nature, which will continue with or without us. (Neutral) 3 | Nature. The natural world is more important than the edifices of the city and civilization. (Neutral) 4 | Interdependence. We are all part of nature's web. (Lawful) 5 | Ambition. The time of Golgari ascendance is at hand, and I intend to have a prominent place in the new world order. (Evil) 6 | Live and Let Live. Meddling in the affairs of other guilds is a great way to get squashed like a bug. (Neutral) Bonds d6 | Bond 1 | I cherish the finger of a family member who was petrified by a medusa. 2 | I have an identical twin who is as different from me as any person could be. 3 | I want to lead one faction of the guild to a new position of dominance. 4 | I love spending time in the moss-covered building where I took part in my first reclamation mission. 5 | I found something in the sewer that must never come to light. 6 | I am forever grateful to the reclaimer who found me floating facedown in the sewer, moments from death. Flaws d6 | Flaw 1 | Death comes for us all, so you can't expect me to take care of someone who can't fight it off. 2 | I assume that anyone outside the Golgari looks down on me. 3 | I feel a need for revenge against those who enjoy the privilege of living above ground. 4 | I don't bother to couch my opinions in flattering words. 5 | I can't help but pocket any trinket or coin I come across, no matter how worthless. 6 | I'm convinced that I'm better and stronger than members of other guilds, isolated as they are from the realities of life and death."

    "traits": {
      "Description": "The Golden Grin began in the far-off land of Tal'Dorei, trading secret messages through a network of bards and minstrels to undermine an iron-fisted king's authoritarian rule. Today, Tal'Dorei is a relatively peaceful republic, and some Grinners have grown restless while waiting for tyranny to raise its ugly head again. A contingent of such Grinners traveled to the Menagerie Coast and set up a network of secret bases in the cities of the Clovis Concord, from which they are presently working their way into the highest echelons of the Dwendalian Empire. You are a Grinner. Your goals are to spread freedom and inspire hope-or, in time, revolution-in the hearts of the oppressed. * Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Performance * Tool Proficiencies: One type of musical instrument, thieves' tools * Equipment: A set of fine clothes, a disguise kit, a musical instrument of your choice, a gold-plated ring depicting a smiling face, and a pouch containing 15 gp Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount p. 200",
      "Favorite Code-Song": "All members of the Golden Grin have learned a handful of folk songs in their travels, and use those songs to send secret codes and alert fellow Grinners to danger. Choose a favorite song or roll on the Favorite Code-Songs table. d6 | Favorite Code-Song 1 | Zan's Comin' Back. This hopeful Tal'Dorei folk song declares the inevitable return of a just ruler. Use it to seek out potential allies. 2 | Blow Fire Down the Coast. A rowdy fighting song from the Clovis Concord, this ditty talks of blasting up pirate ships. Use it to encourage battle. 3 | Hush! Onward Come the Dragons. This Tal'Dorei folk song recounts the terror in the days after the invasion of the red dragon called the Cinder King. Use it to encourage caution in speech and deed. 4 | Let the Sword Grow Rust. An antiwar anthem from Marquet, this song has uncertain origins. Use it to help quell violent encounters. 5 | Drink Deep, Li'l Hummingbird. A drinking rondo from the Menagerie Coast, this song tells the tale of a young person who drinks so heavily that they awaken to find they've stowed away on a ship. Use it to encourage alertness in social situations. 6 | Dirge for the Emerald Fire. This elven song supposedly has thousands of obscure verses. Use the first two verses to spread news of death or defeat.",
      "Feature: Ballad of the Grinning Fool": "Like every Grinner, you know how to find a hideout. In any city of 10,000 people or more on the Menagerie Coast or in the lands of the Dwendalian Empire, you can play the \"Ballad of the Grinning Fool\" in a major tavern or inn. A member of the Golden Grin will find you and give shelter to you and any companions you vouch for. This shelter might be discontinued if it becomes too dangerous to hide you, at the DM's discretion. This feature must be used with caution, for not all who know the ballad are your friends. Some are traitors, counterspies, or agents of tyranny.",
      "Suggested Characteristics": "Grinners are trained in the art of secrecy and innuendo, and are skilled at hiding in plain sight by being the loudest and brightest person in the room. Their skills in subterfuge and combat lend themselves well to an adventuring lifestyle, and traveling with mercenaries and treasure hunters creates a convenient excuse to journey through lands bent under tyranny. d8 | Personality Trait 1 | I love the spotlight. Everyone, look at me! 2 | Give me a drink and I'm your friend. 3 | Talk to me about yourself. I'm a hell of a listener. 4 | I hate to start fights, but I love to finish them. 5 | I can't sit still. 6 | I'm always humming an old tune from my past. 7 | When I don't have a reason to smile, I'm miserable. 8 | I'm lucky like you wouldn't believe. d6 | Ideal 1 | Revolution.

(Neutral) d6 | Bond 1 | I lost someone important to an agent of the Dwendalian Empire. That regime will fall. 2 | The first people to be hurt by this war will be the common folk. I need to protect them. 3 | Music helped me through a dark time in my life. Now, I'll use music to change the world. 4 | I will be known as the greatest spy who ever lived. 5 | All life is precious to me. I know I can change the world without taking a humanoid life. 6 | The elite in their ivory towers don't understand how we suffer. I intend to show them. d6 | Flaw 1 | I've never lied once in my life. What? No, I'm not crossing my fingers! 2 | I do everything big! Subtlety? I don't know the meaning of subtlety! Oh, that's a problem? 3 | Being a spy in wartime is painful. I've seen so much suffering, I think I'm losing my mind. 4 | I can't focus on my mission. I just want to carouse and sing and play! 5 | Yeah, that's my name. Yeah, I'm a Grinner spy.

      "Description": "The entire world of Ravnica is a sprawling metropolis, but you are a native of the wild areas that still exist-the abandoned districts, the rubblebelts, the overgrown parks, and the crumbling ruins.

You will frequently be summoned to participate in a raid your clan is launching against the city or against a group of its defenders. Your clan leader might also send you on a special mission, though it would almost certainly still qualify as a raid. You might join a small group of Gruul warriors on a dangerous charge deep into the settled streets to plunder a certain location, retrieve an item stolen from your clan, or assault a Boros garrison. Sometimes your objective might be more esoteric. With prophecies of the return of Ilharg the Raze-Boar spreading like wildfire among the Gruul druids, you might be asked to carry out some task that the druids believe will speed his coming. Such a task might involve collecting a sacred relic held in an Orzhov vault or collecting sacrifices for a grand ceremony in the Raze-Boar's honor.",
      "Suggested Characteristics": "Gruul ways aren't the ways of civilized folk, and the Gruul have little patience for social niceties.

The five gods believe they were created by the God-Pharaoh, who charged them with teaching the people the ways of the God-Pharaoh, and with protecting them until he comes. The five gods embody the five virtues the God-Pharaoh wishes to cultivate in those who will become his Eternals in the afterlife. Each god is responsible for modeling and teaching one of those virtues to the acolytes and initiates of Naktamun, and then testing those initiates to ensure that they have mastered their teachings. Thus, they are present during the acolytes' first lessons, during the Ceremony of Measuring, during the initiates' intense training, and at each of the trials that are part of an initiate's journey. In the absence of the God-Pharaoh, only the gods can determine whether initiates have proven themselves worthy of the glory of the afterlife. The gods in turn prove their own worthiness by executing their duties infallibly. They make the trials as challenging as possible to ensure that only the most worthy are selected.",
      "Suggested Characteristics": "An initiate's life is focused on the trials, but it doesn't need to be all about the trials. Though some initiates are highly focused on their training, most undergo that training while also experiencing joy, sorrow, love, loss, anger, jealousy, hope, faith, delight-the whole range of mortal emotions and experience. The afterlife might be a constant presence in every initiate's mind, but it is the culmination of a life well-lived-not a replacement for it. d8 | Personality Trait 1 | I always have a joke on hand when the mood gets too serious. 2 | I use sarcasm and insults to keep a distance between myself and my crop-mates, because I don't want to get attached to them. 3 | I'll settle for nothing less than perfection-in myself, in my cropmates, in everything. 4 | I'm so focused on the glorious afterlife that nothing in this life can shake my calm resolve. 5 | I enjoy using my skills to help those who lack those same skills. 6 | I train hard so that I can play hard at the end of the day. I fully expect to play even harder in the glorious afterlife, but I'm not in a hurry to get there. 7 | I'm perfectly happy letting others pick up the slack for me while I take it easy. 8 | I'm constantly sizing up everyone around me, thinking about what kind of opponent they'll be in the final trial. d6 | Ideal 1 | Solidarity. The thing that matters most of all is that we're there for each other. (Lawful) 2 | Knowledge. The world is a puzzle-a mystery waiting to be solved. (Neutral) 3 | Strength. All that matters to me is my own perfection. Let everyone else seek that perfection in their own way. (Any) 4 | Ambition. I'm going to prove that I deserve only the best-of everything. (Evil) 5 | Zeal. Anything worth doing is worth throwing my whole self into. (Any) 6 | Redemption. I will train all the harder to make up for the doubt I entertained when I was younger. (Any) d6 | Bond 1 | One of my crop-mates is my dearest friend, and I hope we will face each other in the final trial. 2 | I am in love with a vizier. 3 | I am particularly drawn to one of the five gods, and I want nothing more than to win that god's particular favor. 4 | I am more devoted to Naktamun and its people than I am to any of the ideals of the gods. 5 | My weapon was a gift from a beloved trainer who died in an accident. 6 | I carry a memento of my time as an acolyte, and I treasure it above all other things. d6 | Flaw 1 | I'm easily distracted by an attractive person, which could be the death of me in the trials. 2 | I really wanted to be a vizier, and I'm angry at the god who didn't choose me. 3 | Training for a lifetime to die in the end seems like a big waste of energy. 4 | I'm not at all sure I'll be able to grant a glorified death to any of my crop-mates. 5 | I have a lasting grudge against one of my crop-mates, and each of us wants to see the other fail. 6 | I think I've figured out that this world is not what it seems.

They were known for traveling to remote parishes plagued by unexplained murders, and for exposing werewolves living among normal humans.

They executed suspected lycanthropes with little or no proof, and punished accused heretics in unsanctioned trials. With Avacyn's madness, this savage form of inquisition has become the norm, and inquisitors who still pry into dark mysteries have become a minority. * Skill Proficiencies: Investigation, Religion * Tool Proficiencies: Thieves' tools, one type of artisan's tools * Equipment: A holy symbol, a set of traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp Source: Plane Shift: Innistrad p. 12",

      "Feature: Urban Infrastructure": "The popular conception of the Izzet League is based on mad inventions, dangerous experiments, and explosive blasts. Much of that perception is accurate, but the league is also involved with mundane tasks of construction and architecture-primarily in crafting the infrastructure that allows Ravnicans to enjoy running water, levitating platforms, and other magical and technological wonders. You have a basic knowledge of the structure of buildings, including the stuff behind the walls. You can also find blueprints of a specific building in order to learn the details of its construction.

For example, when you open the portal of a rope trick spell, the portal might be outlined by harmless, showy sparkles. If you use an arcane focus, it probably takes the form of an intricate device that could include metal gauntlets, glass canisters, copper tubing, and leather straps attaching it to your body. The mizzium apparatus described in chapter 5 is a magical version of this gear. The chaos bolt spell is a favorite of Izzet spellcasters because of its unpredictable nature.",

Whatever I do, I give it all I've got. 4 | I do what my gut tells me. 5 | Life's an experiment, and I can't wait to see what happens. 6 | I pepper my speech with the incomprehensible jargon of my trade, like mizzium droplets inserted into a weird-field suspension. 7 | Great ideas are fine, but great results are what counts. 8 | If you can guess what I'm about to do, that means I've run out of imagination. Ideals d6 | Ideal 1 | Guild. My guild is all that really matters. (Any) 2 | Creativity. Half the world's troubles come from stodgy thinking, stuck in the past. We need innovative solutions. (Chaotic) 3 | Discovery. Every experiment has the potential to reveal more secrets of the multiverse. (Any) 4 | Science. A rigorous application of logical principles and protocols will lead us toward progress more surely than any belief system. (Lawful) 5 | Fun. I love my job! Despite the dangerous working conditions, there's nothing I'd rather do. (Chaotic) 6 | Power. Someday I'll find or create the magic that will make me the most powerful being in Ravnica. (Evil) Bonds d6 | Bond 1 | I have dedicated my life to finding a solution to a scientific problem. 2 | I'll never forget the laboratory where I learned my skills, or the other attendants who learned alongside me. 3 | I'm convinced it was sabotage that destroyed my first laboratory and killed many of my friends, and I seek revenge against whoever did it. 4 | I have the schematics for an invention that I hope to build one day, once I have the necessary resources. 5 | A fellow student and I are racing to solve the same scientific puzzle. 6 | I would do anything the guildmaster told me to do. Flaws d6 | Flaw 1 | If there's a plan, I'll probably forget it. If I don't forget it, I'll probably ignore it. 2 | I get bored easily, and if nothing is happening I'll make something happen. 3 | Nothing is ever simple, and if it seems simple, I'll find a way to make it complicated. 4 | I tend to ignore sleep for days when I'm conducting research, often at the expense of my own health and safety. 5 | I'm convinced there's not a soul in Ravnica, except maybe the great Niv-Mizzet, who can match my boundless intellect. 6 | I'm incapable of admitting a flaw in my logic."

      "Description": "You belong to an order of knights who have sworn oaths to achieve a certain goal. The nature of this goal depends on the order you serve, but in your eyes it is without question a vital and honorable endeavor. Faerûn has a wide variety of knightly orders, all of which have a similar outlook concerning their actions and responsibilities. Though the term \"knight\" conjures ideas of mounted, heavily armored warriors of noble blood, most knightly orders in Faerûn don't restrict their membership to such individuals. The goals and philosophies of the order are more important than the gear and fighting style of its members, and so most of these orders aren't limited to fighting types, but are open to all sorts of folk who are willing to battle and die for the order's cause. The \"Knightly Orders of Faerûn\" sidebar details several of the orders that are active at present and is designed to help inform your decision about which group you owe allegiance to. * Skill Proficiencies: Persuasion, plus one from among Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion, as appropriate for your order * Tool Proficiencies: Your choice of a gaming set or a musical instrument * Languages: Any one of your choice * Equipment: One set of traveler's clothes, a signet, banner, or seal representing your place or rank in the order, and a pouch containing 10 gp Source: Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide p. 151",
      "Feature: Knightly Regard": "You receive shelter and succor from members of your knightly order and those who are sympathetic to its aims. If your order is a religious one, you can gain aid from temples and other religious communities of your deity. Knights of civic orders can get help from the community-whether a lone settlement or a great nation-that they serve, and knights of philosophical orders can find help from those they have aided in pursuit of their ideals, and those who share their ideals. This help comes in the form of shelter and meals, and healing when appropriate, as well as occasionally risky assistance, such as a band of local citizens rallying to aid a sorely pressed knight, or those who support the order helping to smuggle a knight out of town when he or she is being hunted unjustly.",
      "Knightly Orders of Faerûn": "Many who rightfully call themselves \"knight\" earn that title as part of an order in service to a deity, such as Kelemvor's Eternal Order or Mystra's Knights of the Mystic Fire. Other knightly orders serve a government, royal family, or are the elite military of a feudal state, such as the brutal Warlock Knights of Vaasa. Other knighthoods are secular and nongovernmental organizations of warriors who follow a particular philosophy, or consider themselves a kind of extended family, similar to an order of monks. Although there are organizations, such as the Knights of the Shield, that use the trappings of knighthood without necessarily being warriors, most folk of Faerûn who hear the word \"knight\" think of a mounted warrior in armor beholden to a code. Below are a few knightly organizations.",
      "Suggested Characteristics": "Use the tables for the soldier background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a knight of your order. Your bond almost always involves the order to which you belong (or at least key members of it), and it is highly unusual for a knight's ideal not to reflect the agenda, sentiment, or philosophy of one's order."

You can find the taverns and festhalls where mercenaries abide in any area, as long as you speak the language. You can find mercenary work between adventures sufficient to maintain a comfortable lifestyle (see \"Practicing a Profession\" under \"Downtime Activities\" in chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook).",
      "Mercenaries of the North": "Countless mercenary companies operate up and down the Sword Coast and throughout the North. Most are smallscale operations that employ a dozen to a hundred folk who offer security services, hunt monsters and brigands, or go to war in exchange for gold. Some organizations, such as the Zhentarim, Flaming Fist, and the nation of Mintarn have hundreds or thousands of members and can provide private armies to those with enough funds. A few organizations operating in the North are described below.",
      "Suggested Characteristics": "Use the tables for the soldier background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a mercenary. Your bond could be associated with the company you traveled with previously, or with some of the comrades you served with. The ideal you embrace largely depends on your worldview and your motivation for fighting."

      "Origin": "Removed from your life as a townsperson, you've adapted to rough life in the wilds surrounding Phlan. The trade you practiced still influences your outlook, the manner in which you approach situations, and the way you contribute to the resistance movement against the Maimed Virulence. You can roll on the following table to determine what your occupation was before the fall, or choose one that best fits your character (select from either the general column or the specific column, but not both). d8 | Origin (General) | Origin (Specific) 1 | Fisher | Stojanow River Worker 2 | Hunter | Twilight Marsh Worker 3 | Craftsperson | Mantor's Library Scribe 4 | Priest/Priestess | Clergy of Ilmater 5 | Cook | Laughing Goblin Server 6 | City Watch | Black Fist Guard 7 | Servant | House Sokol Retainer 8 | Unskilled Laborer | Bay of Phlan Dockworker",
      "Overview": "The taking of Phlan by Vorgansharax is a clear memory in your mind. You were going about your everyday business when the green dragon's forces spilled out of the sewers and assailed your home. Many of Phlan's citizens, young and old alike, were captured, killed, or offered as tribute to the Maimed Virulence. You, yourself were one of those captured. But, either with the help of adventurers or through your own wits and sheer determination, you escaped. Rather than flee the region, you've chosen to stay and fight. Finding refuge outside the town and the deadly thicket surrounding it, you strike out against the Tears of the Virulence and their monstrous allies. You've learned to survive in dire and desperate circumstances, with supplies running low and the arrival of reinforcements uncertain.

You will drive Vorgansharax out, or you die trying.",
      "Suggested Characteristics": "You have given up the life you knew as a citizen of Phlan. However, the Maimed Virulence's invasion resonates deep inside you. Perhaps you have a few friends or family members who were able to escape with you. Or, perhaps, everyone you held dear either perished or went missing during the fall. You may know of someone who is, against all odds, surviving within the thicket and you long to liberate them from a life of peril within the town. d8 | Personality Trait 1 | My patience knows no bounds, so long as my goal is in sight. 2 | In life and in struggle, the ends justify my actions. 3 | If you aren't helping me, you'd best at least stay out of my way. 4 | I long for the life that was taken away from me. 5 | Friends and family perished, tragically, before my eyes.

They will pay harshly for their transgressions. 4 | An item I hold close is my last remaining connection to the family I lost during the fall. 5 | The dragon who took my past life away from me will feel the full extent of my vengeance. 6 | The knowledge in Mantor's Library is an irreplaceable treasure that must be protected. d6 | Flaw 1 | I have no respect for those who flee. I harbor a deep grudge against the citizens who abandoned Phlan. 2 | Ale is the only way I can escape the desperation of my circumstances. 3 | It doesn't take much to get me into a fight. 4 | Being an insurgent means doing things that aren't always ethical. I'm still learning to live with that. 5 | My desire to liberate Phlan oftentimes clouds my judgment, despite my best efforts. 6 | I relentlessly despise the Maimed Virulence and his allies.

So your role is to execute your vision of grand satire and disruptive performance art, as you aspire to outdo your guild mates and attract the attention of Rakdos himself. You work as part of a troupe, with your artistic talents used in service to a ringmaster's vision. But your performance is your own, and no one expects you to follow a script.

Your first love is the distant line of the horizon, but the time has come to try your hand at something new. Discuss the nature of the ship you previously sailed with your Dungeon Master. Was it a merchant ship, a naval vessel, a ship of discovery, or a pirate ship? How famous (or infamous) is it? Is it widely traveled? Is it still sailing, or is it missing and presumed lost with all hands? What were your duties on board-boatswain, captain, navigator, cook, or some other position? Who were the captain and first mate?

Roll twice on the Selesnya Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Selesnya Contacts table. Selesnya Contacts d8 | Contact 1 | A wise centaur trainer believed in me even though I was a terrible student. 2 | A good friend has risen to become a Ledev guardian. 3 | I left my former guild and joined the Selesnya along with a close friend. 4 | The dryad at the head of my enclave has taken an interest in my activities. 5 | A sibling is an instructor at the guild's training grounds. 6 | One of my parents is a votary, tasked with protecting the temple gardens at the Vitu-Ghazi guildhall. 7 | I had a romance with a well-known Selesnya healer. 8 | Trostani, the head of the guild and the voice of Mat'Selesnya, once welcomed me into her presence. Non-Selesnya Contacts d10 | Contact 1 | I left the Azorius, and a former colleague still resents me for that act. 2 | A good friend, eager for action, left the Selesnya and joined the Boros. 3 | I had a relationship with a guild mate who turned out to be a Dimir agent. 4 | I know a disgruntled Golgari assassin who is ripe for recruitment. 5 | I'm friendly with a Gruul centaur who almost joined us a few years back. 6 | I once had a heated public argument with an Izzet chemister, and neither of us is allowed back into that restaurant. 7 | I paid off my debt to the Orzhov Syndicate, but my good friend was not so lucky and remains indebted to that guild. 8 | At a time of terrible grief in my life, a Rakdos performer made a mockery of my pain, leaving me with mixed feelings of sadness and humor. 9 | Roll an additional Selesnya contact; you can decide if the contact is an ally or a rival. 10 | I have a sibling in the Simic Combine, and we argue every time we see each other.",
      "Description": "You are a member of a blessed community, built on the ideals of harmony. Here, nature and civilization coexist peacefully, living and growing in accordance with the will of the Worldsoul, Mat'Selesnya. As a member of the Selesnya Conclave, you are surrounded by people and other creatures who share your worldview and your longing for deeper spiritual communion with the world, and you have a fervent desire to share the joy you have experienced with Ravnica. Along with the rest of the conclave, you are committed to resisting the ambitions of the other guilds-with military force if necessary. * Skill Proficiencies: Nature, Persuasion * Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan's tools or one musical instrument * Languages: Choose one of Elvish, Loxodon, or Sylvan * Equipment: A Selesnya insignia, a healer's kit, robes, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 5 gp (Azorius 1-zino coins) Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 86",

You and your companions can find a place to hide or rest in any Selesnya enclave in the city, unless you have proven to be a danger to them. The members of the enclave will shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives in this effort. In addition, as a guild member you can receive free healing and care at a Selesnya enclave, though you must provide any material components needed for spells.",
      "How Do I Fit In?": "Although the guild teaches the importance of subjugating the individual will to the good of the conclave, it also celebrates the diversity of individuals, in the same sense that a field that produces different crops is healthier than one that yields a single crop. That principle applies to your skills as an adventurer. As long as your efforts are directed toward advancing the goals of the guild rather than your private agenda, you're allowed to put your talents to work in your unique way. That said, you must never lose sight of the fact that you are part of a larger community. That includes the whole guild, of course, but your ties to community start with your vernadi (enclave) and its voda (dryad leader). The dryads want to know what you're doing and what purpose it serves, and they act to curtail your actions-or even expel you from the guild-if they determine that you aren't serving Selesnya's best interests.",

A sensation of gentle warmth and the smell of spring flowers or autumn leaves might accompany your spells.",
      "Suggested Characteristics": "Most members of the Selesnya Conclave are true believers-the tight-knit community allows little room for the cynical or disillusioned. They are spiritual, empathetic, and generally peaceful-unless roused to action. Their flaws and bonds alike grow naturally from their close ties to the community. Personality Traits d8 | Personality Trait 1 | I never raise my voice or lose my temper. 2 | I feel the pains and joys of everyone around me, friend or foe. 3 | I would rather make a friend than thwart an enemy. 4 | I'm always straining to peer into another reality that seems to be just beyond my senses. 5 | I'm uneasy if I can't see plants growing or feel soil beneath my feet. 6 | Seeing illness or injury in any creature saddens me. 7 | I have much to be proud of, but I am still just one strand in the grand, interwoven tapestry of life. 8 | Nature offers rich and abundant metaphors for understanding the complexities of life. Ideals d6 | Ideal 1 | Guild. My guild is all that really matters. (Any) 2 | Harmony. Nothing is more beautiful than voices and actions aligned in common purpose. (Good) 3 | Order. Like a well-pruned tree, society thrives when everything is kept in good order. (Lawful) 4 | Life. Preserving life and nature is always a worthwhile endeavor. (Good) 5 | Humility. Ambition and pride are the roots of strife. (Good) 6 | Evangelism. When all have joined the Selesnya Conclave, Ravnica will finally know peace. (Any) Bonds d6 | Bond 1 | I would give my life in the defense of the small enclave where I first encountered Mat'Selesnya. 2 | I love beasts and plants of all kinds, and am loath to harm them. 3 | A healer nursed me to recovery from a mortal illness. 4 | I'll sing the invitation of Mat'Selesnya with my dying breath. 5 | I cherish a leaf from Vitu-Ghazi that changes color with the seasons, even though it is no longer attached to the tree. 6 | Every member of the conclave is my kin, and I would fight for any one of them. Flaws d6 | Flaw 1 | I'm terrified of getting into a fight where my side is outnumbered. 2 | I assume that people mean well until they prove otherwise. 3 | I enjoy comfort and quiet, and prefer to avoid extra effort. 4 | I have a fierce temper that doesn't reflect the inner calm I seek. 5 | I'm convinced that everyone else in the conclave has a deeper connection to the Worldsoul than I do. 6 | I'm trying to atone for the life of crime I led before I joined the Selesnya, but I find it hard to give up my bad habits."

You can roll a d6 or choose from the options in the Research Options table to determine your area of research. Research Options d6 | Clade/Project 1 | Hull Clade, focused on protection and durability 2 | Fin Clade, focused on movement 3 | Gyre Clade, focused on cyclical patterns and metamagic 4 | Guardian Project, focused on creating guard monsters and super soldiers 5 | Crypsis Project, focused on intelligence and counterintelligence 6 | Independent research in a new area",
      "Contacts": "The fluid nature of clades, whose rosters span different laboratories and change as researchers discover new interests, creates abundant connections among the Simic. The guild members live in watery sinkholes called zonots, and their isolation shelters them from much contact with outsiders. Nonetheless, a fair number of Simic members are former members of other guilds. Roll twice on the Simic Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Simic Contacts table. Simic Contacts d8 | Contact 1 | My research builds on my parents' work and takes it in interesting new directions. 2 | If a serious problem confounds me, I can count on my mentor to provide clarity of thought. 3 | A former laboratory colleague went on to work on the Guardian Project. 4 | A former colleague has ventured into fields of research that are possibly immoral and almost certainly illegal. 5 | A former lover is now the supervisor of a prominent clade. 6 | My sibling has become an almost unrecognizable mutant. 7 | An old friend has retreated into a secluded life as an ascetic deepsage, devoted to contemplating philosophical principles. 8 | My former clade supervisor is now engaged in field research studying some of the largest beasts and monsters on Ravnica. Non-Simic Contacts d10 | Contact 1 | My older sibling is upset that I didn't follow them into the Azorius. 2 | A Boros sergeant is always asking questions about my work, but I suspect they're genuinely curious. 3 | A friend in my clade thinks I don't know they're a Dimir agent. 4 | I helped a Golgari spore druid with the fertilization and growth of their fungus field. 5 | I can't fathom what could have made my childhood friend run off and join the Gruul. 6 | I love comparing notes with my friend in the Izzet, though our fields of research are very different. 7 | I borrowed a lot of money from an Orzhov syndic to help finance my research. 8 | A Rakdos ringmaster has taken an interest in my research which, come to think of it, might make a nice sideshow act. 9 | I left the Selesnya-and a lover-behind when I joined the Simic. 10 | Roll an additional Simic contact; you can decide if the contact is an ally or a rival.",
      "Description": "Imagine a perfect world: one in which nature and civilization exist in harmony, adapted to each other; one in which life is shaped to match its environment and the environment is shaped to match life. That's the world you have been trying to grow in the laboratories of the Simic Combine. Nature is all about adaptation, evolution, and balance-but for it to keep up with the pace of advancing civilization, nature needs some help from biomancers and terraformers. If, along the way, you happen to create super-soldiers and mutant monsters that can bolster the combine's defenses against the schemes and ambitions of the other guilds, so much the better. * Skill Proficiencies: Arcana, Medicine * Languages: Two of your choice * Equipment: A Simic insignia, a set of common clothes, a book of research notes, an ink pen, a Ink (1-ounce bottle), a oil (flask) (made from blubber), a acid (vial) (derived from digestive juices), a vial of fish scales, a vial of seaweed, a vial of jellyfish stingers, a glass bottle of unidentified slime, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp (Azorius 1-zino coins) Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 93",
      "Feature: Researcher": "When you attempt to learn or recall a magical or scientific fact, if you don't know that information, you know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a Simic laboratory, or sometimes from an Izzet facility, a library, a university, or an independent scholar or other learned person or creature. Knowing where the information can be found doesn't automatically enable you to learn it; you might need to offer bribes, favors, or other incentives to induce people to reveal their secrets. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an inaccessible place, or that it simply can't be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.",
      "How Do I Fit In?": "As a Simic adventurer, your mission likely aligns with the Adaptationist philosophy; the disagreements and tensions among the guilds will soon erupt into open conflict, and your guild needs your help to ensure that the Simic survive. That help might come in the form of defending against Golgari incursions into Simic zonots or shielding Simic research from Azorius intrusion. It could also involve more subtle, diplomatic work to maintain balance among the guilds, or subterfuge aimed at undermining another guild's grab for power. Self-improvement is also an important part of your mission. Anything you can do to make yourself more capable-whether learning a new spell or adopting a new hybridizing mutation-gives the Simic a stronger weapon in its arsenal. The combine must change to survive, and that means individual members of the guild must grow and adapt as well.",
      "Simic Guild Spells": "Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature For you, the spells on the Simic Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.) Simic Guild Spells Spell Level | Spells Cantrip | acid splash, druidcraft 1st | detect poison and disease, expeditious retreat, jump 2nd | alter self, enhance ability, enlarge/reduce 3rd | gaseous form, water breathing, wind wall 4th | freedom of movement, polymorph 5th | creation When your magic causes physical alterations in yourself or others, the result often displays the characteristics of fish, amphibians, or other water-dwelling creatures. Blue-green eddies of magical energy sometimes accompany your spellcasting, forming spirals that reflect the mathematical perfection of nature.",

(Good) 5 | Logic. It's foolish to let emotions and principles interfere with the conclusions of logic. (Lawful) 6 | Superiority. My vast intellect and strength are directed toward increasing my sway over others. (Evil) Bonds d6 | Bond 1 | I helped create a krasis that I love like a pet and would carry with me everywhere... except it's the size of a building, and it might eat me. 2 | In my laboratory, I discovered something that I think could eliminate half the life on Ravnica. 3 | The other researchers in my clade are my family-a big, eccentric family including members and parts of many species. 4 | The laboratory where I did my research contains everything that is precious to me. 5 | I will get revenge on the shortsighted fool who killed my precious krasis creation. 6 | Everything I do is an attempt to impress someone I love. Flaws d6 | Flaw 1 | I have a rather embarrassing mutation that I do everything I can to keep hidden. 2 | I'm more interested in taking notes on monstrous anatomy than in fighting monsters. 3 | Every social situation I'm in seems to lead to my asking rude personal questions. 4 | I'm supremely confident in my ability to adapt to any situation and handle any danger. 5 | I'll take any risk to earn recognition for my scientific brilliance. 6 | I have a tendency to take shortcuts in my research and any other tasks I have to complete."

      "Claim to Fame": "Every smuggler has that one tale that sets them apart from common criminals. By wits, sailing skill, or a silver tongue, you lived to tell the story-and you tell it often. You can roll on the following table to determine your claim or choose one that best fits your character. d6 | Accomplishment 1 | Spirit of the Whale. You smuggled stolen dwarven spirits in the body of a dead whale being pulled behind a fishing boat. When you delivered the goods, the corpse suddenly exploded, sending whale meat and whiskey bottles for half a mile. 2 | Cart and Sword. You drove a cart filled with stolen art through the middle of a battlefield while singing sea shanties to confuse the combatants. 3 | The Recruit. You enlisted in another nation's navy for the purpose of smuggling stolen jewels to a distant port. You attained a minor rank before disappearing from the navy and making your way here. 4 | River of Shadows. Your riverboat accidentally slipped through the veil into the Shadowfell for several hours. While you were there, you sold some stolen dragonborn artifacts before returning to this plane and paddling home. 5 | Gold-Hearted. You agreed to transport a family escaping a war. The baby began to cry at a checkpoint, and you gave the guards all your gold to let you pass. The family never found out about this gesture. 6 | Playing Both Sides. You once smuggled crates of crossbow bolts and bundles of arrows, each destined for an opposing side in a regional war, at the same time. The buyers arrived within moments of each other but did not discover your trickery.",
      "Description": "On a rickety barge, you carried a hundred longswords in fish barrels right past the dock master's oblivious lackeys.

I will find that thief. 6 | I give most of my profits to a charitable cause, and I don't like to brag about it. Smuggler Flaws d6 | Flaw 1 | Lying is reflexive, and I sometimes engage in it without realizing. 2 | I tend to assess my relationships in terms of profit and loss. 3 | I believe everyone has a price and am cynical toward those who present themselves as virtuous. 4 | I struggle to trust the words of others. 5 | Few people know the real me. 6 | Though I act charming, I feel nothing for others and don't know what friendship is."

      "Overview": "You are one of the many people that make sure the trade routes are clear at ALL times. You assure that the Great Law of Trade is followed at all costs. You work by yourself or in groups to quell bandits and brigands who might stop trade routes from going through. You investigate potential ambushes and possible rumors as to someone wanting to rob or stop caravans. You are as much an investigator as you are law enforcement. You are able to go into a town/village around the Hillsfar area and find a contact that is willing to give you information from rumor to fact. This sometimes comes at a cost of a minor bribe of 1-9 silver pieces.",
      "Suggested Characteristics": "d8 | Personality Trait 1 | I am always polite and respectful 2 | I let my actions speak for themselves 3 | I am haunted by my past having seen the murder of a close friend or family member and it is the one case I always needed to solve but have not been able to. 4 | I am quick to judge and slow to vindicate 5 | I can be very persuasive and am able to ask quest ions where others might not be able to. 6 | I have a quirky personality that seems to take others off their guard. 7 | My sense of humor is considered by most to be awkward. 8 | Everyone has a choice, and they can always make the right choice, mine! d6 | Ideal 1 | Hope. my job is to speak for the victim (Good) 2 | Dedicated. Once I start an investigation, until told to do so, I do not quit, not matter where it leads. (Lawful) 3 | Nation. My city, nation, or people are all that matter. (Any) 4 | Mercenary. When I do investigations, I expect answers immediately. (Any) 5 | Eloquent. I use my words to sway others to give me answers. (Good) 6 | Might. It is through threats and force that I get my answers.

  "Urban Bounty Hunter": {
    "name": "Urban Bounty Hunter",
    "traits": {
      "Description": "Before you became an adventurer, your life was already full of conflict and excitement, because you made a living tracking down people for pay. Unlike some people who collect bounties, though, you aren't a savage who follows quarry into or through the wilderness. You're involved in a lucrative trade, in the place where you live, that routinely tests your skills and survival instincts. What's more, you aren't alone, as a bounty hunter in the wild would be: you routinely interact with both the criminal subculture and other bounty hunters, maintaining contacts in both areas to help you succeed. You might be a cunning thief-catcher, prowling the rooftops to catch one of the myriad burglars of the city. Perhaps you are someone who has your ear to the street, aware of the doings of thieves' guilds and street gangs. You might be a \"velvet mask\" bounty hunter, one who blends in with high society and noble circles in order to catch the criminals that prey on the rich, whether pickpockets or con artists. The community where you plied your trade might have been one of Faerûn's great metropolises, such as Waterdeep or Baldur's Gate, or a less populous location, perhaps Luskan or Yartar-any place that's large enough to have a steady supply of potential quarries. As a member of an adventuring party, you might find it more difficult to pursue a personal agenda that doesn't fit with the group's objectives-but on the other hand, you can take down much more formidable targets with the help of your companions. * Skill Proficiencies: Choose two from among Deception, Insight, Persuasion, and Stealth * Tool Proficiencies: Choose two from among one type of gaming set, one musical instrument, and thieves' tools * Equipment: A set of clothes appropriate to your duties and a pouch containing 20 gp Source: Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide p. 153",
      "Feature: Ear to the Ground": "You are in frequent contact with people in the segment of society that your chosen quarries move through. These people might be associated with the criminal underworld, the rough-and-tumble folk of the streets, or members of high society. This connection comes in the form of a contact in any city you visit, a person who provides information about the people and places of the local area.",
      "Suggested Characteristics": "Use the tables for the criminal background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your bounty hunter's traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a bounty hunter. For instance, your bond might involve other bounty hunters or the organizations or individuals that employ you. Your ideal could be associated with your determination always to catch your quarry or your desire to maintain your reputation for being dependable."

  "Urchin": {
    "name": "Urchin",
    "traits": {
      "Description": "You grew up on the streets alone, orphaned, and poor. You had no one to watch over you or to provide for you, so you learned to provide for yourself. You fought fiercely over food and kept a constant watch out for other desperate souls who might steal from you. You slept on rooftops and in alleyways, exposed to the elements, and endured sickness without the advantage of medicine or a place to recuperate. You've survived despite all odds, and did so through cunning, strength, speed, or some combination of each. You begin your adventuring career with enough money to live modestly but securely for at least ten days. How did you come by that money? What allowed you to break free of your desperate circumstances and embark on a better life? * Skill Proficiencies: Sleight of Hand, Stealth * Tool Proficiencies: Disguise kit, Thieves' tools * Equipment: A small knife, a map of the city you grew up in, a pet mouse, a token to remember your parents by, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp Source: Player's Handbook p. 141",
      "Feature: City Secrets": "You know the secret patterns and flow to cities and can find passages through the urban sprawl that others would miss. When you are not in combat, you (and companions you lead) can travel between any two locations in the city twice as fast as your speed would normally allow.",
      "Suggested Characteristics": "Urchins are shaped by lives of desperate poverty, for good and for ill. They tend to be driven either by a commitment to the people with whom they shared life on the street or by a burning desire to find a better life-and maybe get some payback on all the rich people who treated them badly. d8 | Personality Trait 1 | I hide scraps of food and trinkets away in my pockets. 2 | I ask a lot of questions. 3 | I like to squeeze into small places where no one else can get to me. 4 | I sleep with my back to a wall or tree, with everything I own wrapped in a bundle in my arms. 5 | I eat like a pig and have bad manners. 6 | I think anyone who's nice to me is hiding evil intent. 7 | I don't like to bathe. 8 | I bluntly say what others are hinting at or hiding. d6 | Ideal 1 | Respect. All people, rich or poor, deserve respect. (Good) 2 | Community. We have to take care of each other, because no one else is going to do it. (Lawful) 3 | Change. The low are lifted up, and the high and mighty are brought down. Change is the nature of things. (Chaotic) 4 | Retribution. The rich need to be shown what life and death are like in the gutters. (Evil) 5 | People. I help the people who help me-that's what keeps us alive. (Neutral) 6 | Aspiration. I'm going to prove that I'm worthy of a better life. (Any) d6 | Bond 1 | My town or city is my home, and I'll fight to defend it. 2 | I sponsor an orphanage to keep others from enduring what I was forced to endure. 3 | I owe my survival to another urchin who taught me to live on the streets. 4 | I owe a debt I can never repay to the person who took pity on me. 5 | I escaped my life of poverty by robbing an important person, and I'm wanted for it. 6 | No one else should have to endure the hardships I've been through. d6 | Flaw 1 | If I'm outnumbered, I will run away from a fight. 2 | Gold seems like a lot of money to me, and I'll do just about anything for more of it. 3 | I will never fully trust anyone other than myself. 4 | I'd rather kill someone in their sleep than fight fair. 5 | It's not stealing if I need it more than someone else. 6 | People who can't take care of themselves get what they deserve."

  "Uthgardt Tribe Member": {

    "traits": {
      "Barbarian Tribes of Faerûn": "Though this section details the Uthgardt specifically, either it or the outlander background from the Player's Handbook can be used for a character whose origin lies with one of the other barbarian tribes in Faerûn. You might be a fair-haired barbarian of the Reghed, dwelling in the shadow of the Reghed Glacier in the far North near Icewind Dale. You might also be of the nomadic Rashemi, noted for their savage berserkers and their masked witches. Perhaps you hail from one of the wood elf tribes in the Chondalwood, or the magic-hating human tribes of the sweltering jungles of Chult.",
      "Description": "Though you might have only recently arrived in civilized lands, you are no stranger to the values of cooperation and group effort when striving for supremacy. You learned these principles, and much more, as a member of an Uthgardt tribe. Your people have always tried to hold to the old ways. Tradition and taboo have kept the Uthgardt strong while the kingdoms of others have collapsed into chaos and ruin. But for the last few generations, some bands among the tribes were tempted to settle, make peace, trade, and even to build towns. Perhaps this is why Uthgar chose to raise up the totems among the people as living embodiments of his power. Perhaps they needed a reminder of who they were and from whence they came. The Chosen of Uthgar led bands back to the old ways, and most of your people abandoned the soft ways of civilization. You might have grown up in one of the tribes that had decided to settle down, and now that they have abandoned that path, you find yourself adrift. Or you might come from a segment of the Uthgardt that adheres to tradition, but you seek to bring glory to your tribe by achieving great things as a formidable adventurer. See the \"Uthgardt Lands\" section of chapter 2 for details on each tribe's territory and its activities that will help you choose your affiliation. * Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Survival * Languages: Any one of your choice * Tool Proficiencies: One type of musical instrument or artisan's tools * Equipment: A hunting trap, a totemic token or set of tattoos marking your loyalty to Uthgar and your tribal totem, a set of traveler's clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp Source: Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide p. 153",
      "Feature: Uthgardt Heritage": "You have an excellent knowledge of not only your tribe's territory, but also the terrain and natural resources of the rest of the North. You are familiar enough with any wilderness area that you can find twice as much food and water as you normally would when you forage there. Additionally, you can call upon the hospitality of your people, and those allied with your tribe, often including members of the druid circles, tribes of nomadic elves, the Harpers, and the priesthoods devoted to the gods of the First Circle.",
      "Suggested Characteristics": "Use the tables for the outlander background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a member of an Uthgardt tribe. Even if you have left your tribe behind (at least for now), you hold to the traditions of your people. You will never cut down a still-living tree, and you may not countenance such an act being done in your presence. The Uthgardt ancestral mounds - great hills where the totem spirits were defeated by Uthgar and where the heroes of the tribes are interred - are sacred to you. Your bond is undoubtedly associated with your tribe or some aspect of Uthgardt philosophy or culture (perhaps even Uthgar himself). Your ideal is a personal choice that probably hews closely to the ethos of your people and certainly doesn't contradict or compromise what being an Uthgardt stands for."

    "name": "Vizier",
    "traits": {
      "Description": "You are a vizier, a servant of your god. You perform tasks that are essential to facilitating the initiates' journey, so the gods reward you with entry into the afterlife with the God-Pharaoh's blessing. You hope to achieve the most honored status in the afterlife by being the best possible servant to your god. As a vizier, you can have any class, but you are especially likely to be a cleric, a druid (particularly if you serve Rhonas), or a paladin. * Skill Proficiencies: History, Religion * Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan's tools, one type of musical instrument * Equipment: A set of artisan's tools or a musical instrument (one of your choice), a scroll of your god's teachings, a vizier's cartouche, a set of fine clothes, and a pouch containing 25 gp Source: Plane Shift: Amonkhet p. 10",
      "Feature: Voice of Authority": "Your voice is the voice of your god, at least in theory. Your job might include training and instructing initiates, and they are required to obey you. In any circumstance, an initiate is expected to defer to your voice and obey your commands. If you abuse this authority, though, your god might personally punish you.",
      "Suggested Characteristics": "A vizier's characteristics strongly reflect the ideals and personality of the god they serve. d10 | Personality Trait 1 | Everything I do, I do gracefully and deliberately, and with complete confidence. (Oketra) 2 | Nothing can shake my rock-hard focus. (Oketra) 3 | When I am at peace, I am an oasis of perfect calm in the world. When I am roused to anger, I am an embodiment of terror. (Kefnet) 4 | I enjoy teasing acolytes and initiates with juicy tidbits of knowledge wrapped up in fiendishly difficult puzzles. (Kefnet) 5 | I have the utmost faith in myself and my abilities. (Rhonas) 6 | I get restless when life in the city feels too tame, too safe. (Rhonas) 7 | I enjoy solitude as an opportunity to plan my victory. (Bontu) 8 | I use satire as a way to undermine the teachings of the other gods. (Bontu) 9 | I love, fight, and feast with equal zeal. (Hazoret) 10 | I think of those in my care as my family, in a way that most people have trouble understanding. (Hazoret) d6 | Ideal 1 | Solidarity. The worthy must respect the worthy. In the afterlife, all will be united in goal and action. (Oketra) 2 | Knowledge. The worthy shall cultivate a nimble mind, so as to perceive the wonders beyond imagination that wait in the afterlife. (Kefnet) 3 | Strength. The worthy shall hone a strong body that can withstand the boundless energies of the afterlife. (Rhonas) 4 | Ambition. The worthy shall strive for greatness, for supremacy in life leads to supremacy in the afterlife. (Bontu) 5 | Zeal. The worthy shall rush to the God-Pharaoh's side with relentless passion, rising to overcome every obstacle in their way. (Hazoret) 6 | Naktamun. The life of the city is ordered according to the plan of the God-Pharaoh, and that order must be preserved at all costs. d6 | Bond 1 | My loyalty to my companions embodies the ideal of loyalty to my god. (Oketra) 2 | The teachings of my god are more precious to me than any possession. (Kefnet) 3 | I would do anything to defend the temple of my god from any harm or desecration. (Rhonas) 4 | I am committed to the service of my god-because it's my sure ticket into the afterlife. (Bontu) 5 | I love my god and never want my service to end. (Hazoret) 6 | I have a close friend or lover who is also a vizier. d6 | Flaw 1 | I am in love with an initiate, and I want to shield this person from death in the trials. 2 | I secretly wish I had not been chosen as a vizier, so I could participate in the trials as an initiate. 3 | I secretly question whether the gods care at all about us or what we do. 4 | A vizier of another god seeks my death in retribution for a past insult. 5 | I am terrified of what lies beyond the Gate to the Afterlife. 6 | I secretly believe the God-Pharaoh's return will not bring blessing to this world."

      "Description": "The Volstrucker are a clandestine organization of arcane assassins and enforcers in the service of the Cerberus Assembly. Their operatives bear no official title, but are referred to in hushed tones as \"scourgers\" by residents of large Dwendalian cities such as Zadash and Rexxentrum. You are a Volstrucker agent. Your duty is to silence dissidents who would undermine the will of King Dwendal-and more importantly, the will of the Assembly. * Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Stealth * Tool Proficiencies: Poisoner's kit * Languages: One of your choice * Equipment: A set of common clothes, a black cloak with a hood, a poisoner's kit, and a pouch containing 10 gp Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount p. 202",
      "Feature: Shadow Network": "You have access to the Volstrucker shadow network, which allows you to communicate with other members of the order over long distances. If you write a letter in a special arcane ink, address it to a member of the Volstrucker, and cast it into a fire, the letter will burn to cinders and materialize whole again on the person of the agent you addressed it to. The ink used to send a letter across the shadow network is the same as that used by a wizard to scribe spells in a spellbook. Writing a letter in this ink costs 10 gp per page.",
      "Suggested Characteristics": "Agents of the Volstrucker are groomed to follow orders without question and to kill without mercy. The trauma that brings one into the order can fester even more strongly against the darkness of a Volstrucker agent's assignments. Officially, no one ever leaves the order-but those desperate enough do whatever it takes to gain some measure of freedom. d6 | Personality Trait 1 | I prefer to keep my thoughts to myself. 2 | I indulge vice in excess to quiet my conscience. 3 | I've left emotion behind me. I'm now perfectly placid. 4 | Some event from the past keeps worming its way into my mind, making me restless. 5 | I always keep my word-except when I'm commanded to break it. 6 | I laugh off insults and never take them personally. d6 | Ideal 1 | Order. The will of the crown is absolute. (Law) 2 | True Loyalty. The Cerberus Assembly is greater than any power, even the crown. (Law) 3 | Death. The penalty for disloyalty is death. (Evil) 4 | Determination. I cannot fail. Not ever. (Neutral) 5 | Fear. People should not respect power. They should fear it. (Evil) 6 | Escape. The Volstrucker are pure evil! I can't atone for what I've done for them, but I can escape with my life. (Any) d4 | Bond 1 | The job is all that matters. I will see it through. 2 | My orders are important, but my comrades are worth more than anything. I would die for them. 3 | Everything I've done, I've done to protect someone close to me. 4 | If the empire falls, all of civilization falls with it. I will hold back chaos and barbarism at any cost. d4 | Flaw 1 | I drink to dull the pain in the back of my head. 2 | I go a bit mad when I see blood. 3 | I can hear the voices of everyone I've killed. I see their faces. I can't be free of these ghosts. 4 | Fear is a powerful motivator. I will do whatever it takes to prevent those who know what I am from seeing me fail, and from those I care about from knowing what I am.",
      "Tragedy": "Happy people aren't selected to join the Volstrucker. The Cerberus Assembly preys upon talented individuals who have been broken by tragedy-in some cases, tragedy that the Volstrucker has arranged for. A slightly broken mind is more easily reshaped and reeducated. Choose the tragedy that set you on this path, or roll on the Tragedies table. d6 | Tragedy 1 | Familicide. Through deceit or manipulation, the Volstrucker convinced you to slaughter your own family. 2 | Amnesia. You were forced to study magic so potent that it strained your mind beyond mortal limits, stealing away the memories of your past. 3 | Capture. You were captured and tortured by agents of the Kryn Dynasty, and barely escaped. 4 | Starvation. A terrible blight afflicted your rural village, and many of your friends and family members starved to death. You survived, but only barely. 5 | Disfigurement. One of your arcane experiments went wrong and scarred or dismembered you so gravely that others now shun you. Only the Volstrucker showed you kindness after that day. 6 | Vicissitude. You were once the scion of a wealthy family who lost their entire fortune in the blink of an eye."

  "Waterdhavian Noble": {
    "name": "Waterdhavian Noble",
    "traits": {
      "Description": "You are a scion of one of the great noble families of Waterdeep. Human families who jealously guard their privilege and place in the City of Splendors, Waterdhavian nobles have a reputation across Faerûn for being eccentric, spoiled, venal, and, above all else, rich. Whether you are a shining example of the reason for this reputation or one who proves the rule by being an exception, people expect things of you when they know your surname and what it means. Your reasons for taking up adventuring likely involve your family in some way: Are you the family rebel, who prefers delving in filthy dungeons to sipping zzar at a ball? Or have you taken up sword or spell on your family's behalf, ensuring that they have someone of renown to see to their legacy? Work with your DM to come up with the family you are part of-there are around seventy-five lineages in Waterdeep, each with its own financial interests, specialties, and schemes. You might be part of the main line of your family, possibly in line to become its leader one day. Or you might be one of any number of cousins, with less prestige but also less responsibility. * Skill Proficiencies: History, Persuasion * Languages: Any one of your choice * Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set or musical instrument * Equipment: A set of fine clothes, a signet ring or brooch, a scroll of pedigree, a skin of fine zzar or wine, and a purse containing 20 gp Source: Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide p. 154",
      "Feature: Kept in Style": "While you are in Waterdeep or elsewhere in the North, your house sees to your everyday needs. Your name and signet are sufficient to cover most of your expenses; the inns, taverns, and festhalls you frequent are glad to record your debt and send an accounting to your family's estate in Waterdeep to settle what you owe. This advantage enables you to live a comfortable lifestyle without having to pay 2 gp a day for it, or reduces the cost of a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle by that amount. You may not maintain a less affluent lifestyle and use the difference as income-the benefit is a line of credit, not an actual monetary reward.",
      "Suggested Characteristics": "Use the tables for the noble background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a member of a Waterdhavian family. Like other nobles, you were born and raised in a different world from the one that most folk know - one that grants you privilege but also calls you to fulfill a duty befitting your station. Your bond might be associated with your family alone, or it could be concerned with another noble house that sides with or opposes your own. Your ideal depends to some extent on how you view your role in the family, and how you intend to conduct yourself in the world at large as a representative of your house."
